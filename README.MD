## Go-ebay

A package to help you communicate with eBays MWS api.

## Project Status

Big thanks to user cubixle who originally created the package which you can
find at https://github.com/cubixle/go-ebay

I have forked the code for use in my own API projects and have made several changes
and bugfixes which may or may-not eventually get merged into the original repo.
Mostly I have been working on the Orders API and have fixed a number of structs which
werent originally getting populated correctly.

I will continue to work through the various structs and APIs as I need them in my own
work.  As such the code is useable but please beware that there are still a number of
bugs which you'll have to fix in the various APIs when trying to use it.

Please feel free to submit pull requests if you fix anything.
